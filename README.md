# CLI COMMAND API Project using ASP .NET Core MVC

After having a UNIX Environment class in college. All of my friends were complaining about how hard to remember each of the command line and how to use it. It turned out to be a good idea for me to practice by build an API that allow you to store and get their code snippets and description

Building an API
ASP .NET Core 
MVC Architecture
C#

SQL Server 
Entity Framework Core such as DBContext and Migration
DTOs and AutoMapper
Provide 6 endpoints (GET (all or by id) , POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and status code
